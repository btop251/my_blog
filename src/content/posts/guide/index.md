## Where to Place the Post Files



Your post files should be placed in `src/content/posts/` directory. You can also create sub-directories to better organize your posts and assets.

```
src/content/posts/
├── post-1.md
└── post-2/
    ├── cover.png
    └── index.md
```

Just copy the embed code from YouTube or other platforms, and paste it in the markdown file.
